# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Crowdfunding Analysis plays and general success of campaigns for Louise; charts and descriptive statistics of specific campaigns and those related to her goals
---
## Overview of Project
#### The purpose of this analysis is to aid Louise in creating a successful campaign to fund her attempt as a new playwright. She is nervous about making sure she can secure funds for a $10,000+ production and wants to use data and charts to make sure she has the best chance to be successful. This analysis contains 4,114 campaigns on Kickstarter from 2009 - 2017, including goal, success, location, and category/theme of each campaign.  
#### There are many constraints to maintain what she wants such as the country, the category and subcategory of the campaign, and minimum goal she needs to ask for her play.  To be most helpful to Louise, charts are included to help determine the best time of year to start the campaign, exactly how much money to ask for, and how much to expect from each donation to advertise her effort to a willing audience.

## Analysis and Challenges
#### First, the Kickstarter data needed to be amended to include readable dates and separate the categories and subcategories of the campaigns so that  plays could be studied specifically. We color coded whether each campaign succeeded, failed or was canceled and added a color scale to easily visualize how successful each campaign was by the percent of expected funding received.

#### From these additions, charts were created to show an overall comparison of plays to other categories - there were many more plays and theater related campaigns than any other type.
